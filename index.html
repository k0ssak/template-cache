      <p>So you have that your fancy App/Page/Site/Shop. Doesnt really matter. And you have some fancy javascript that does cool stuff but sometimes you hate that You see this blink before javascript does the work and turns your small green square into big red awesome square. Just like on this page. Just hit "refresh" few times and see what does JS do.</p>
      
      <div id="amazing-square"></div>

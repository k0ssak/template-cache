# template-cache #

So you have that your fancy App/Page/Site/Shop. Doesnt really matter. And you have some fancy javascript that does cool stuff but sometimes you hate that blink before javascript does the work and turns your small green square into big red awesome square.

This is the small service worker which deals with that problem.

Demo:
Withouot service worker: https://k0ssak.github.io/template-cache/
With service worker: https://k0ssak.github.io/template-cache/fixed.html

Just hit "refresh" few times on both sites and see the difference. (yep it still doesnt solve the first load problem)
